Hello everyone!
Here is a subtle attempt of me trying to tag you guys along my journey of starting to learn Data Structures and Algorithms. Now this series is not something that is guaranteed
to get you a job, infact I'm not even studying DSA to get a job, I mean yeah that is an added benefit maybe, but I'm studying this for my love of CS.

## This isn't my first time!
